Cohort 15 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.

Our team utilized a dataset from a large online grocery delivery service consisting of information on customer order history to predict when a customer, or user as it is defined in our data, will be likely to order again. With this information in hand the business will in turn be able to focus a calculated amount of their advertising budget on users they suspect will be likely to have larger gaps between their orders placed.

The dataset obtained contains a relational set of five csv files each with varying amount of information on a userâ€™s orders completed over time. In total, more than 200,000 users with over 3 million orders completed are represented in the data.



the number of days since prior order for each user fell into the below distribution which became our target groups:

-A group of orders occurring within 0-7 days

-A group of orders occurring between 8-29 days

-A group of orders occurring beyond 30+ days
